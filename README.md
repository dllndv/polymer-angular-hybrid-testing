# polymer-angular-hybrid-testing
This is a test app using both polymer and angular to see how we can test both with Protractor. 

It's built with kd7yva's polymer-startup app, which can be found here along with instructions on how to run the app: https://github.com/kd7yva/polymer-startup
Also most of the code I used to make the app came from this article by Josh Crowther: http://jcrowther.io/2015/05/26/using-polymer-webcomponents-with-angular-js/

I'll put up a confluece article with my findings soon, and will put the link to it here.

Feel free to clone this, add your own polymer components, angular bits, and whatever else, and have fun testing it!
